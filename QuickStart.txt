Quick Start Instructions for Jakarta Activation TCK

================================
Running the TCK from the source 
================================

1. Checkout TCK workspace in TCKHOME (e.g., "jaf-tck).
     git clone git@github.com:eclipse-ee4j/jaf-tck.git
   Change directory to $TCKHOME.
2. Place jakarta.activation.jar in any location. Let's call it JARPATH. 
   It's usually simplest to just put them in $TCKHOME.
3. Set CLASSPATH to
     $TCKHOME/javatest.jar:$JARPATH/jakarta.activation.jar
    
     on Windows:
     %TCKHOME%\javatest.jar;%JARPATH%\jakarta.activation.jar

4. Set ANT_HOME to $TCKHOME/tools/ant.
5. Add $ANT_HOME/bin to your path.
6. In TCKHOME, execute 'ant build'.  This will compile all source under
   $TCKHOME/tests and $TCKHOME/harness into $TCKHOME/classes.
   This invocation of ant must use JDK 9 or newer.
7. Open $TCKHOME/lib/ts.jte and $TCKHOME/lib/ts.pluggability.jte for editing.
   In the file set the TS_HOME, JARPATH and JAVA_HOME.
   JAVA_HOME must be set to JDK 9 or newer.
   Save and close the file.
8. In tests/SignatureTest.html, change the sig file name to match the version of
   Java SE you are using.  e.g. for Java SE 9, it should say
   "-FileName jakarta.activation_1.2_java_9.sig" 
9. In $TCKHOME, execute the following command to start the TCK in batch mode:
     'ant run'
   Alternatively, you can run 'ant gui' to start the TCK in gui mode.

    If you are running on Windows, change the following property in
    lib/ts.jti:

    jtwiz.environment.env=jafWindows

10. After the TCK suite finishes running, the report can be found in
    $TCKHOME/JTreport/index.html


================================
      Releasing the TCK
================================

1. Follow steps 1 thru 10 as listed in the
   "Running the TCK from the source" section.
2. If you need to record a sig file, in TCKHOME, execute 'ant record.sigtest'.
   This will create a new sig file in TCKHOME for the version of Java SE you
   are using. 
3. Open $TCKHOME/lib/ts.jte and $TCKHOME/lib/ts.pluggability.jte for editing.
   In the file, unset the TCKHOME, JARPATH, and JAVA_HOME
   variables. Save and close the file. 
4. In the workspace now execute:
     ant -f release.xml [-Dversion=tck_version]

   Where tck_version is the Activation TCK version number

   This command zips the necessary files into activation-tck-[tck_version].zip.

   Note that this command assumes the TCK will be installed in a directory
   named "activation-tck".
